## Description

This module provides the intuition and skills required to design, implement, test logistic regression and classification and validate it with resampling. It introduces the difference between modelling with the goal of prediction compared with inference, and discusses choices between prediction accuracy and model interpretability, and the bias-variance trade-off. 

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students will:
1. Implement and interpret the results from several supervised learning approaches for regression and classification
2. Use resampling methods to select a model
3. Determine what is required for reproducible learning
4. Analyze the uncertainties associated with model results and the ethical consequences of acting on these results
5. Explain the different trade offs and considerations for the statistical methods in their toolkit to both technical and non-technical audiences

## Logistics

### Module Contacts
**Questions can be submitted to the #questions channel on Slack**

* Technical Facilitator: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Technical Facilitator can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
* Learning Support Staff: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Technical Facilitator can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.

### Requirements

* Participants are expected to have completed Shell, Git, and Python.
* Participants are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Participants must have VSCode installed with the following extensions:
    * [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
    * [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
* Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be use as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect participants to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/tree/main/onboarding_documents).
* Camera is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.

### Delivery of Module

The module will run sychronously three times a week on Zoom. The first three days are used as "lectures" and will last a maximum of 3 hours. During this time, the Technical Facilitator will introduce the concepts for the week. The last day is used for as optional, asychronous work periods. The work periods will also last for up to 3 hours. During the work period, an Technical Facilitator or a Learning Support Staff will be present on Zoom to assist participants reach the intended learning outcomes.

The technical facilitator will introduce the concepts through a collaborative live coding session using the Python notebooks found under `/01_slides`. The technical facilitator will upload any live coding files to this repository for any participants to revisit under `/live_code`.
Â 
### Expectations

Participants are encouraged to be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout the module.

## Grading Scheme

Grading is based on three components: 3 assignments, and class participation. The grading scheme is as follows:

| Assessment       | Number |  Individual Weight | Cumulative Weight
|------------------|--------|--------------------|------------------|
| Assignments      | 3      |  25%               | 75%              |
| Participation    | NA     |  NA                | 25%              |

**Assignments**

Assignments will cover key statistical concepts and related code implementation. The assignments are to complete according to the schedule below, for a total of 3 assignments. Assignments will be introduced in class, can be discussed in tutorial, and questions can be ask of the Technical Facilitator and/or Learning Support staff over email. Assignments are due by 11:59PM on the day they are due. Please arrange for extensions *in advance* with the Technical Facilitator or the TAs. Assignments should be submitted through the correct Google Forms link found below following the naming convention `firstname_lastname_a#`.

Assignments can be found in the `Assignments` directory, above. We've included an .html file (knitted Markdown file) for easy reading, as well as Jupyter Notebook files, that can be edited for submission. (To download files, click Raw > Save as.)

Note: If the assignment requires some content we end up not covering in class (i.e., we've fallen behind), it will be removed from the assignment / not be graded (you're welcome to submit answers if you like). Any questions that are removed will be determined and clearly indicated in the class before the assignment is due.

**Assignment Due-dates**

| Assessment        | Content         | Due Date                         | Submission Link |
