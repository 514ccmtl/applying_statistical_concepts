# What is Statistical Learning?

Suppose we want to figure out the \alert{association between the allocation of advertising budgets and sales} in order to increase sales for a client.

-   There are three types of advertising: TV, radio, and newspaper which can be labelled $X_1, X_2, and\ X_3$ respectively.

-   The advertising budgets are the independent variables, or **predictor variables**.

-   The sales is the dependent variable, or **response variable** which we label Y.When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Each observation in the dataset has a value for the predictors $X_1, X_2, X_3,$ and the response $Y$.

# What is Statistical Learning?

The sales in relation to each of the advertising budgets are shown along with a simple fitted line for the relationships.

# What is Statistical Learning?

We want to find the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable.

We can assume that there is a relationship between $X = (X_1, X_2, X_3)$ and $Y$ which can be written in the general form

```{=tex}
\begin{block}{}
$$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$

\begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ is a fixed unknown function of the predictor variables.
    \item $\epsilon$ is a random error term which has mean zero.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
```
\alert{Statistical learning is summarized by the set of approached which are used to estimate $f$.}
