# Introduction

Survival analysis and censored data are related to the analysis of the outcome variable best described as "the time until and event occurs". Some examples include:

-   Predicting survival time of patients diagnosed with cancer.

-   Predicting the time a customer will cancel a subscription.

-   Predicting the customer wait time for a call centre.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Survival and Censoring Times

For each individual we assume there exists:

-   $T$: the true **survival time** which represents the time at which the event of interest occurs.      *Ex: The time at which the patient dies.*

-   $C$: the true **censoring time** which is when the censoring occurs.          *Ex: The time at which the patient drops out of the study.*

However, we only ever observe the time that comes first: $$Y=\min (T, C)$$ In order to keep track of which time $Y$ represents, we also have a status indicator: $$
\delta=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text { if } T \leq C \\
0 & \text { if } T>C
\end{array}\right.$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Survival and Censoring Times

Suppose we have the following data from a medical study with $n = 4$ patients. We observe 4 pairs of $(Y, \delta)$, denoted as $(y_1, \delta_1), \dots, (y_4, \delta_4)$.

-   For patient 1 and 3, we observe the time to the event (i.e. death) during the study.

    -   Thus, $\delta_1 = \delta_3 = 1$

-   Patient 2 survives until the end of the study.

    -   Thus, $\delta_2 = 0$

-   Patient 4 drops out of the study early.

    -   Thus, $\delta_4 = 0$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Independent Censoring

We assume that the censoring mechanism is independent. That is, the \alert{event time $T$ is independent of the censoring time $C$}.

Example of a violation:

-   Some patients drop out of a cancer study because they are very sick.

-   If we analyse the data without considering why patients drop out then we will overestimate the true average survival time.

The data collection process must be examined closely to check whether independent censoring is a reasonable assumption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve

The Kaplan-Meier survial curve (or survival function) is a decreasing function that \alert{quantifies the probability of surviving past time $t$}. It is defined by $$S(t)=\operatorname{Pr}(T>t)$$ Estimating $S(t)$ is complicated by the presence of censoring but we have an approach to overcome this challenge.

-   $d_{1}<d_{2}<\cdots<d_{K}$ denote the $K$ unique survival times among the non-censored individuals.

-   $q_k$ denotes the number of events that took place at time $d_k$. (i.e. the number of patients that died at time $d_k$)

-   $r_k$ denotes the number of individuals alive and in the study just before $d_k$ (the **at risk** patients).

-   The set of patients that are at risk are the **risk set**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve

So, the probability of surviving past time $d_k$ is given by: $$
S\left(d_{k}\right)=\operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{k}\right)=\operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{k} \mid T>d_{k-1}\right) \operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{k-1}\right).
$$ Note that $\operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{k-1}\right)$ amounts to $S\left(d_{k-1}\right)$. So, $$S\left(d_{k}\right)=\operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{k} \mid T>d_{k-1}\right) S\left(d_{k-1}\right).$$ Thus, $$
S\left(d_{k}\right)=\operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{k} \mid T>d_{k-1}\right) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{2} \mid T>d_{1}\right) \operatorname{Pr}\left(T>d_{1}\right)
$$ Now we need the estimates for each of these terms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve

The estimator $$
\widehat{\operatorname{Pr}}\left(T>d_{j} \mid T>d_{j-1}\right)=\left(r_{j}-q_{j}\right) / r_{j}
$$ is the fraction of the risk set at time $d_j$ who survived past time $d_j$. So, the **Kaplan-Meier estimator** of the survival curve is 
$$\widehat{S}\left(d_{k}\right)=\prod_{j=1}^{k}\left(\frac{r_{j}-q_{j}}{r_{j}}\right)$$

-   For times $t$ between $d_k$ and $d_{k+1}$ we set $\widehat{S}(t)=\widehat{S}\left(d_{k}\right)$.

-   This gives the Kaplan-Meier survival curve a step-like shape.

# The Log-Rank Test

The log-rank test aims to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between two survival curves. The statistic is computed with $$W=\frac{X-\mathrm{E}(X)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X)}}$$ where $\mathrm{E}(X)$ and $\operatorname{Var}(X)$ are the expectation and variance under the assumption of the null hypothesis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Log-Rank Test}

Suppose we want to \alert{compare the survival of two groups of people} by comparing the two survival curves.

Recall:

-   $d_{1}<d_{2}<\cdots<d_{K}$ are the unique survival times among the non-censored individuals.

-   $r_k$ is the number of individuals at risk at time $d_k$.

-   $q_k$ denotes the number of patients that died at time $d_k$

Now we define:

-   $r_{1k}, r_{2k}$ are the number of individuals at risk at time $d_k$ in group 1 and 2 respectively.

-   $q_{1k}, q_{2k}$ are the number of patients that died at time $d_k$ in group 1 and 2 respectively.

-   Note that $r_{1 k}+r_{2 k}=r_{k}$ and $q_{1 k}+q_{2 k}=q_{k}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Log-Rank Test

At each death time $d_k$, we have the following table:

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|cc|c} 
& Group 1 & Group 2 & Total \\
\hline Died & $q_{1 k}$ & $q_{2 k}$ & $q_{k}$ \\
Survived & $r_{1 k}-q_{1 k}$ & $r_{2 k}-q_{2 k}$ & $r_{k}-q_{k}$ \\
\hline Total & $r_{1 k}$ & $r_{2 k}$ & $r_{k}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
```
-   $\frac{r_{1 k}}{r_{k}}$ is the proportion of at risk individuals that are in group 1.

-   If there is no difference in the survival rate between the two groups, we would expect $\frac{r_{1 k}}{r_{k}}q_{k}$ individuals in group 1 to die at time $d_k$.

-   So, $\mathrm{E}\left(q\_{1 k}\right)=\frac{r_{1 k}}{r_{k}} q\_{k}$ is the expected number of deaths at time $d_k$ in group 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Log-Rank Test

In our case, the log rank test statistic is computed with $$
W=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(q_{1 k}-\mathrm{E}\left(q_{1 k}\right)\right)}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \operatorname{Var}\left(q_{1 k}\right)}}
$$ where $$
\operatorname{Var}\left(q_{1 k}\right)=\frac{q_{k}\left(r_{1 k} / r_{k}\right)\left(1-r_{1 k} / r_{k}\right)\left(r_{k}-q_{k}\right)}{r_{k}-1}.
$$

-   When the sample size is large, $W$ has approximately a standard normal distribution.

-   Then, a $p$-value can be used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the survival curves of the two groups.

# Regression with a Survival Response

Suppose we would like to fit a regression model to survival data with the following properties.

-   $n$ observations $(Y, \delta)$

    -   $Y = \min (T, C)$.

    -   $\delta$ equals 1 if $Y = T$ and 0 otherwise.

-   $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is a vector of $p$ features.

-   We want to predict the true survival time $T$.

Note that we want to predict $T$, not $Y$. Censoring makes this difficult so we make use of the **hazard function**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Hazard Function

The hazard function $h(t)$ is \alert{the death rate in the instant after time $t$, given survival past that time}. That is, $$h(t)=\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\operatorname{Pr}(t<T \leq t+\Delta t \mid T>t)}{\Delta t}$$ where $T$ is the unobserved survival time. We take the limit as $\Delta t$ approached zero so we can think of $\Delta t$ as an extremely small number.

Now we want to use the hazard function to model the survival time as a function of the covariates $x_{ij}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Proportional Hazards Assumption

The **proportional hazards assumption** states $$h\left(t \mid x_{i}\right)=h_{0}(t) \exp \left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)$$

-   $h_0 (t) \geq 0$ is an unspecified function known as the **baseline hazard** which is the hazard function for an individual with features $x_{i 1}=\cdots=x_{i p}=0$.

-   $\exp \left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)$ is called the **relative risk** for the feature vector $x_{i}=\left(x_{i 1}, \ldots, x_{i p}\right)$ relative to $x_{i}=(0, \ldots, 0)$.

\-$\beta=\left(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{p}\right)$ are the parameters that we need to estimate using the likelihood (we will not present the likelihood function).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Proportional Hazards Assumption

Since the baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ is unspecified the only assumption we are making is that a \alert{one-unit increase in $x_{ij}$ corresponds to an increase in $h(t|x_i)$ by a factor of $\exp \left(\beta_{j}\right)$}.

-   Left plots show the log hazards and right plots show the survival functions.

-   Green is for $x_i = 0$ and black is for $x_i = 1$.

-   Top model satisfies the assumption.

# Cox Proportional Hazards Model

Because $h_0(t)$ in the proportional hazards assumption is unknown we cannot plug $h(t|x_i)$ into the likelihood to get estimates for $\beta=\left(\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{p}\right)$.

\alert{Cox's proportional hazards model says that it it possible to estimate $\beta$ without specifying the form of $h_0(t)$.}

- Use the **partial likelihood** which is valid regardless of the the value of $h_0(t)$.

- Maximize the partial likelihood with respect to $\beta$.

- We can obtain $p$-values corresponding to null hypotesis such as $H_0: \beta_j = 0$.

- We can obtain confidence intervals associated with the estimated coefficients.

# Cox Proportional Hazards Model

Suppose we have a single binary predictor $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$ and we want to determine whether there is a difference between the survival times of the observations in the two groups.

- *Approach #1:* Fit a Cox proportional hazards model and test the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta = 0$.

- *Approach #2:* Perform a log-rank test to compare the two groups.

In the case of a binary predictor both methods will yield the same result!
